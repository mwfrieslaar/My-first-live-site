    Overview
  </h3>
  <p>
    I finished matric in 1986. After which I started
    in the IT industry as a computer operator. I got
    married in 1997, had two boys and devorced in 2004.
    In 2005 I started working for CSA in a desaster 
    recovery enviroment. Setting up of clone sites to see 
    how fast a company can be up and running after a desaster.
    In 2006 I started working as a customer service 
    engineer for absa. Completing my A+ three times. I also
    certified myself with on the job courses for IBM, DELL, HP,
    XEROX ect. Due to COVID and unforseen clauses within the
    TCM contract I could no longer move with absa after the contract
    ended. As for many of us, we ether had to relocate or take the
    package. I decided to take the package. For the past 2 years I 
    rekindled my interest in programming and started learning front-end
    coding. This is part of my Portfolio.

  <h3>
    Bytes 2014 - 2015
  </h3>
  <p>
    As I was dedicated to absa, but not employed directly by 
    absa, my contract stated that I go wherever absa goes. This 
    meaning that once GIJIMA's contract came to an end and BYTES
    won the contract, BYTES had to employ me to. Here I continued 
    surporting absa's hardare and software as explained
    in Employment with TCM. Bytes lost the contract 
    after a year.
